  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p>I chose to take Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals because I have always been fascinated by the use of 3D printers as well as design and technology. I thought that this elective would be able to help me build up my skills in areas outside of Media, Arts and Design which is the course that I am currently enrolled in</p>
  <p>I have many different hobbies and interests as well. My main hobbies are:</p>
  <ul class="hobbies">
    <li>Drawing</li>
    <li>Playing the piano</li>
    <li>Playing video games</li>
  </ul>
  <div id="bottom">
  <p>I am interested in pursuing a career in the animation sector. I am currently specialising in Animation and Game Art in my course which is Media, Arts and Design because I have had a passion for drawing and the arts for as long as I remember and look forward to learning more in my course as well as this elective.</p>
