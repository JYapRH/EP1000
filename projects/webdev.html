    <h1>Website Development</h1>

  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>We learnt how to write HTML in order to document our progress throughout this elective on a website. Documentation is extremely important because it is a way to collect information, enables the recovery of knowledge and generates resources based on the information in your documentation.</p>
  <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML is easy to learn and use, it is an open-source programme that can be free of cost, it is supported in all kinds of browsers and it is easy to edit when needed.</p>
  <p>We learnt about the structure of a HTML website as well as how to build one by first creating a folder and creating a file called index.html within that folder. Additionally, we learnt how to write things in HTML such as headings, paragraphs and make lists with html code and attach other files to those lists. I found that despite HTML code looking quite confusing and overwhelming at first, it was quite straightforward and there are many sources where you might be able to find help developing your HTML website.</p>

    <p>And this is what it looked like as an actual website</p>

  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>We also learnt about CSS which is used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS can be written within the HTML file itself but it is recommended that it is written in an external CSS file </p>
  <p>CSS selectors are used to find the HTML element that you want to style. The different selectors are element, class and id.</p>
  <p>I personally found CSS to be very interesting to learn because as a design student, I enjoyed thinbking about how I would want to design my website and how I would do it with a Cascading Style Sheet(CSS)</p>
  <p>I was tasked to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE">Jake Wright's </a>website as a base and modify it to suit browsers of min .width 1024 pixels which i did by changing the px measurement to %. I also had to change the colours and fonts to my liking and have a project page showing what I had changed.</p>
