    <h1>Arduino</h1>
  </div>
    <p> We learnt about what electricity is as well as electrical components. We also learnt about how to use a breadboard which is a construction base for building electronics. It is used in many prototyping projects and is used for the quick testing of circuits.</p>
    <p>We were tasked to create a 555 timer in TinkerCAD and simulate it. The 555 timer is configured as an astable using R and C values and the result is and alternating ON/OFF signal which flashes the LED.</p>

    <p>We also learnt about Embedded Systems. Embedded Systems are a dedicated computer system with a dedicated function within a larger system to perform a specific task. E.g. smart TVs, ovens. We will be working with Arduino Systems. It has open source libraries and support. It is inexpensive as there are lots of clones and 3rd party manufacturers. It has a simple, clear programming environment using GUI and is also cross-platform.</p>
    <p>Next, we learnt about how to code with Arduino. Arduino code is loosely based on C++. A digital I/O pin can input or output digital (0, 5v) signals. The Arduino system provides 3 functions for the manipulation of digital I/O. We were also taught about the Analog I/O. Analog signals need to be converted to digital values before they can be processed.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>I was tasked to create a circuit whereby I have one switch that was able to control 3 LEDS and how they lit up. Initially, all of the LEDs are off. When the switch is pressed, the red LED turns on. When it is pressed again, the green LED turns on. When pressed again, the yellow LED turns on. When pressed again, all of the LEDs turn on. When pressed again, the LEDs flash between red, green then yellow. Finally, when it is pressed again, all of the LEDs turn off and they return to the first state</p>
