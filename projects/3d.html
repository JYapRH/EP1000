    <h1>3D Printing</h1>
     </div>
    <p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. It can create almost anything, anyone can manufacture it and it is ideal for rapid prototyping. However, it is also a slow process that may not have material strength</p>
    <p>We learnt about the types of 3D printers that are available at FabLab such as the Ultimaker 2+ and the Creality Ender 3 Pro v2 as well as the differences between all of the types of 3D printers. We also learnt about the steps we have to take in order to start 3D printing. The object that we would be 3D printing was the chess piece that we had designed previously to learn about CAD and Fusion 360.</p>
    <p>The slicer settings are also extremely important when it comes to 3D printing. We were taught about infill percentages which affect the strength of the printed model, supports which are used to help in the printing of overhangs and are removed after the printing is finished as well as many other settings and what they do.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create a 3D model of the object that you want to 3D print and extract it into a file like .STL</p>

  <p>Step 2: Use a slicer (In this case, I am using CURA) to slice the model into layers and extract the layers into a machine readable file</p>

    <p>Step 3: Move the files into an SD card and insert the SD card into the 3D printer to start printing</p>
