    <h1>Laser Cutting</h1>
  </div>
    <p>Computer Controlled Cutting performs cutting operations based on digital data which is provided from CADD operations and digital 2D designs. It provides accurate and precise cutting that can be repeated. We learned about the process of laser cutting and designed a name tag for us to cut out of acrylic using the laser cutter at FabLab.</p>
    <div id="phototext">
    <p>Step 1: Create a 2D design using Fusion 360 or other CAD software and export it into a file like DXF</p>
  </div>

  <div id="phototext">
    <p>Step 2: Import the file into CorelDraw which is provided with the laser cutter that you are using. CorelDraw allows us to add words onto our design that we can engrave</p>
    <p>Step 3: Send the file to the laser cutter</p>

      <h2>Laser Cut Music Box</h2>
      <p>For this topic, my assignment was to design a music box and laser cut it. It required a movable lid, had to accomodate "mechanical hand-cranked music box movement", had to be drawn and modelled in Fusion 360, could be glued together instead of using nails or hinges and had to be "decorated" in some manner</p>

    <div id="phototext">
      <p>Here is the box that i modelled in Fusion 360. From here, I selected the sketches and created dxf files from them so that I would be able to laser cut all of the individual sides of my music box.</p>
    </div>

     <div id="phototext">
      <p>I laser cut out my music box and with the help of my lecturer, I added a design by importing an image of a pattern into CorelDRAW. I also drilled a hole into one of the sides of my music box that I measured so that it sould be able to fit the hand crank of the music box component.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="phototext">
      <p>After cutting out all of the pieces and drilling the hole, I glued all of the pieces together. To ensure that the pieces stayed together while the glue dried, I taped them together with masking tape.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="phototext">
      <p>Here is my finished music box</p>

    <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
    <div id="phototext">
      <p>I did not realise that the original model I created in Fusion 360 had a flaw. The front and the back of my music box were not identical and did not fit onto the base of my music box. I had to cut out another side so that it would fit on my music box.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="../images/Music2.JPG" alt="Music" class="center">
    <div id="phototext">
      <p>From this experience, I learnt to double check that my model is exactly how I want it and make sure that I made no errors in Fusion 360 before I send the model to be cut by the laser cutter.</p>
