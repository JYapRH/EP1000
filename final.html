  <table class="process">

      <td>
        <p>Next, I created a paper prototype of the box with the same dimensions as the one in the my original sketch. By doing this, I was able to ensure that all of my components would fit as well as decide if I liked how it looked. I realised that the box looked too wide and was also not long enough so I changed my dimensions.</p>

        <p>This is the final box design that I created using Fusion360. The original dimensions of the box from my sketch were 200mm(L) x 150mm(W) x 100mm(H). The new dimensions are 220mm(L) x 130mm(W) x 90mm(H). I had to keep in mind that I would be working with 5mm plywood for the box so I had to ensure that the inside would be able to fit my components. I did this by adding 10mm to the length, width and height of the box.</p>

    <td>This support is for the acrylic to rest on so that it does not rest on top of the neopixel. It is 175mm(L) x 35mm(W) x 5mm(H) and the hole is 120mm(L) x 4.5mm(W). I will only be cutting 1.</td>
    <td>This support is for the acrylic itself. It is 175mm(L) x 35mm(W) x 5mm(H) and the hole is 120mm(L) x 5mm(W) so that the acrylic can slide in and stay in place. I will cut 4 of them to make sure that the acrylic is fully supported and will not fall.</td>

        <p>I arranged all of the dxf files that I had of the parts I wanted lasercut in 5mm wood in corelDRAW and made it hairline. I made sure that I put all of my pieces relatively close together so that I would not waste material. The settings I used for the cutting were originally Speed: 15%, Power: 85% and Frequency: 60%. I had to continuously change the settings to cut the wood because a lot of the pieces would not cut through fully.</p>

      <td><img src="./images/laser2.JPG" alt="Prototype"></td>
      <td>
        <p>Next, I arranged the acrylic design in corelDRAW as well as the image for engraving. I set them to hairline then made the part to cut red and made tha part to engrave black. The dxf file of my acrylic had problems but when I made it into a pdf, it worked wonderfully. The settings I used to cut the 5mm acrylic were Speed: 5%, Power: 80% and Frequency: 80%. The settings that I used to engrave the 5mm acrylic were Speeed: 100% and Power:35%. Some of my acrylic was not fully engraved so I porbably should have increased the power a little bit.</p>
